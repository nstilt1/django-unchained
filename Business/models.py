from django.db import models

# Create your models here.


#- the model itself has `title`, `description`, `address` and `employees`.

#- Use `drf` to create crud for that model.
#- Use Postgres for database.
#- Use `Postman` for testing the APIs and when they work flawlessly generate documentations with postman docs.
